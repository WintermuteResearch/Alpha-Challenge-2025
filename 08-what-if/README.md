# What if... ? - Tier 3

Imagine that one of the large stETH holders ([in an illegal way](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xa284a1bc4c7e0379c924c73fcea1067068635507254b03ebbbd3f4e222c1fae0)) just sold tokens using only onchain AMM pools with horrible execution. All explorers are down, so you can’t easily find what pools are skewed at the moment (you can try Tenderly for a 25% score cut, though), but you’re sure it should be the largest ones, so feel free to check via RPC.

You don’t have any capital at the moment, but you think you can find a way to return at least 75M USDC to the victim (just hold funds in your wallet for the verification). Can you?

*We ended with 85M USDC in this hardly imaginable situation, let us know if you beat it.*

*UPD: `twxia` ended with 88.8M USDC, who can save more?*
