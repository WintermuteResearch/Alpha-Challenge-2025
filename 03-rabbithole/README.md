# Rabbithole - Tier 2

It turns out that Vyper has a bug, and some of the Curve pools were vulnerable, so you observed how, despite whitehat efforts, three different pools were drained. A few days later, you found that exploiters returned funds for two of them, but what about [the CRV/ETH one](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb752def3a1fded45d6c4b9f4a8f18e645b41b324)? You have reasons to believe that this exploiter is responsible for some of the other DeFi exploits that have occurred in the same year.

Please provide at least two examples (with different exploiter EOAs) of the previous exploits with Etherscan links and the reasoning that proves connections (some high-level details about the methodology could be helpful for solidifying proofs as well). You canâ€™t use any data after 5th August, 2023 to prove your points.
