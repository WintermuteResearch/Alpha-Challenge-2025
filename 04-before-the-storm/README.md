# Before the storm - Tier 2

UwU Lend was drained for $20M a few days ago, and you found that [the exploiter](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6F8C5692b00c2eBbd07e4FD80E332DfF3ab8E83c)’s Llamalend position became unhealthy, so it’s time to liquidate it. You have no capital at the moment, so the only way to do it is by using a flash loan.

Do whatever it takes to have at least 20k CRV in your registered wallet after the liquidation.

Run the test case with `forge test --match-test test_Solution -vv`
