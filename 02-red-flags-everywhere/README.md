# Red Flags Everywhere - Tier 1

You were responsible for the tech due diligence of a new shiny Ethereum SVM L2, which just launched [testnet](https://github.com/Eclipse-Laboratories-Inc/dev-docs/tree/main/developers/rpc-and-block-explorers#eclipse-testnet). In the end, you passed on investing because of multiple red flags, but now you want to check how's it going.

1. Their testnet had no downtime, but was the blob posting on Celestia also consistent? If not, what were the gaps in posting?
2. For good or bad, this L2 went live. What were the top-5 activity sources for last month, and what's their economic sense?
3. Amongst whale depositors, you found [one of the market makers](https://etherscan.io/address/0x88cf132d5d46c390391344a1ec8bb98340d8a066). What do they do on the L2? Provide a few examples of DeFi positions they had there. Provide explorer links, if possible.
